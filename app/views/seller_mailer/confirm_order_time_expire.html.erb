<p>Hello,</p>

<p>RE: Auction <%= @auction.reference %></p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to your failure to confirm your selection as the winning bidder of the auction from <%= @auction.buyer.billing_address.company%> for <%= @auction.product.name %>, your participation rights have been rescinded. </p>

<p>  In order to ensure adherence to the production schedule implemented in the auction, we have set forth strict timelines to meet specific milestones throughout the project lifecycle. These must be met promptly.</p>

<p>We hope you are able to participate in future auctions and follow the project lifecycle to fruition. </p>

<p>Sincerely, <br/>
The PromoExchange Team</p>
