# backend

This repo contains the api's used by the PE application.
As the API's mature I expect they will be promoted out to their own repo.

** IMPORTANT **

Run most development commands within bundle exec.

Recommended to have an alias in your .bash_profile

    alias be='bundle exec'

You should start the development server inside GUARD


    be guard
