JK-7000,Magic Mat in Cello Sleeve,243,3w x 2h,"A truly amazing product! Simply place the magic mat on the dashboard of your car (or anywhere you need something to stick!)....and see how your cell phone or sunglasses won't slide off! The Magic Mat is super safe and will not harm your dash or items! Best placement of the imprint is in any of the 4 corners as the piece is less functional where the ink is applied. Packaged with instructions and individually wrapped in a cello bag. Great mailing piece... fits into a #10 envelope",,,9,250,18L x 6W x 15H,6906,,Black,Business,,
