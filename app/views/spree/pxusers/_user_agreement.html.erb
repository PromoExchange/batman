<h4>V. Intellectual Property</h4>
<p>The Web Site, its content (except for third-party content) and all intellectual property rights included therein (including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and patents) are privately owned or licensed and all right, title, and interest therein shall remain the property of the owners, licensors, their licensees, successors and assigns thereof. Accordingly, You agree that You will not remove any copyright, trademark or other intellectual property or any proprietary notice or legend contained on the Web Site or its content.

<h4>VI. PromoExchange Is Only a Venue; Limitation of Liability and Relationship</h4>
<p>The Web Site provides an Independent Venue for Sellers to offer and sell Promotional Merchandise and for Buyers to post RFBs and purchase promotional products from Sellers. PromoExchange has no control over the quality, safety, or legality of the Promotional Merchandise offered and sold, the accuracy of any related content, the ability of Sellers to sell Promotional Merchandise, or the actual intent of Buyers to buy Promotional Merchandise. PromoExchange does not guarantee nor does it control whether Sellers will complete the sale of Promotional Merchandise they offer or whether Buyers will complete the purchase of Promotional Merchandise  for which they have requested Bids. Because PromoExchange does not and cannot control the actions of users of the Web Site, in the event that You have a dispute with one or more users, You agree to and hereby do release PromoExchange from any and all claims, demands, and damages (whether actual, direct, indirect, consequential, or punitive) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of, or in any way connected with, such disputes. You also agree to waive the provisions of any state law limiting or prohibiting a general release or to the fullest extent permitted by federal, state, or local law, whichever release of liability is greatest in favor of PromoExchange.</p>

<h4>VII. Bid Process</h4>
<p>The Bid Process is as follows: 1) The Buyer posts a RFB; 2) Each Seller reviews the Specifications and either submits or does not submit a Bid (during the Reverse Auction process, each Seller may submit multiple Bids); 3) If Seller submits a Bid, the submission of the Bid constitutes confirmation of compliance with all Specifications and that Seller will be responsive to all Bid Validation requests – Partial Bids shall be rejected and removed from the Web Site; and 4) The Buyer reviews Bids and decides to: i) Cancel the RFB, in which case all participating Sellers will be notified, ii) post a modified RFB, in which case the Bid Process begins anew, or iii) Select a Bid. All Sellers submitting Bids on a RFB will compete in the Buy until the Buy process expires as specified in the RFB and as determined by the Web Site system clock, or upon selection of a Bid by a Buyer or Cancellation of a RFB by Buyer. A Seller may cancel its Bid or withdraw from an Auction at any time prior to termination of the Auction by Buyer or selection by Buyer of Seller’s Bid.</p>
<p>Throughout the Bidding Process, the Web Site will rank the Bids based on Best Price; however, the Buyer maintains the right to use Offline Factors for award decisions. Buyer need not choose the Selected Bid based solely on Best Price. Buyer may choose Selected Bid based on any criteria Buyer deems appropriate. PromoExchange will provide Sellers with their Bid Status; Selected or Not Selected; or Cancelled. If two or more equal Bids are submitted, they will be ranked according to time of submission, with the previously submitted equal Bid leading as compared to any subsequently submitted equal Bid. A Buyer is NEVER obligated to complete the transaction, regardless of the status of the Buy, prior to issuing a purchase order to Seller, at which time standard commercial rules apply, and a Buyer may select any of the participating Sellers in order to obtain the most advantageous Bid in accordance with Buyer’s contracting authority and applicable rules and regulations; however, the Selected Seller may not retract or cancel its Selected Bid except in the extraordinary event that the Buyer: (a) materially changes the description and/or quantity of the Promotional Merchandise specified in the RFB, (b) has materially misrepresented the Promotional Merchandise in the RFB, or (c) a system error has occurred on the Web Site creating an error in the Bid(s) or RFB. A Buyer cannot designate more than one Selected Seller per Buy. A Buyer cannot solicit or accept Partial Bids in a Reverse Auction. Non-compliance with PromoExchange’s Bid Process may subject Sellers to negative ratings from Buyers and may lead to suspension or revocation of some or all of Your PromoExchange access privileges. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN THE RFB, BIDS SUBMITTED BY SELLERS IN RESPONSE TO A RFB MUST BE IN U.S. DOLLARS. BASED ON THE SELLER’S INPUTS, THE WEB SITE WILL INCLUDE ESTIMATED SALES TAX, INCLUDING STATE, COUNTY, AND MUNICIPAL SALES TAX, IN THE BID. WHERE BUYER PAYS SELLER DIRECTLY, ALL LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL SALES TAXES WILL BE CALCULATED, COLLECTED, AND HELD BY THE BUYER OR SELLER, WHOMEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT OF ANY SALES TAX TO ANY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY. IN THE EVENT THAT BUYER USES THE WEB SITE TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE, THE FULL BID PRICE WILL BE SUBMITTED BY BUYER AND PROMOEXCHANGE WILL FORWARD THE FULL AMOUNT, LESS THE PROMOEXCHANGE FEE TO SELLER, WHO REMAINS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ALL SALES TAXES TO ANY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY. PROMOEXCHANGE IS PROVIDING ESTIMATED SALES TAX ONLY, AND IS NOT GIVING TAX ADVICE. BUYERS AND SELLERS SHOULD CONSLUT THEIR OWN ACCOUNTANTS AND/OR COUNSEL CONCERNING TAX ISSUES AND WHAT SALES TAX AMOUNTS ARE OWED.</p>

<h4>VIII. Cancelling the Auction &amp; Buy-It-Now</h4>
<p>Buyers may choose to cancel the Reverse Auction at any time prior to selecting a Bid. If the Reverse Auction is cancelled, Buyer may post a new or modified RFB seeking Bids.</p>
<p>In accordance with Section VII, above, Buyers may choose to end the Bid Process prior to the expiration of the Reverse Auction at the sole discretion of the Buyer by selecting a Bid. Such decision shall constitute a Buy-It-Now Transaction, in which case payment will be remitted in accordance with the terms set forth herein.</p>

<h4>IX. PromoExchange Fees</h4>
<p>Subscribing to PromoExchange is free to Buyers and Sellers; however, PromoExchange applies a proportional PromoExchange Fee to all Bids within a particular Auction and includes the PromoExchange Fee in the Bid Price submitted to the Buyer for consideration. Unless otherwise agreed by PromoExchange and Buyer, the resulting PromoExchange Fee for any Buy is included in the payment from the Buyer to the Selected Seller or the third party for which the Selected Seller is acting as authorized representative or agent. ACCORDINGLY, EACH SELLER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL PROMOEXCHANGE FEES ARE THE PROPERTY OF PROMOEXCHANGE AND THAT, AS SELECTED SELLER, IT WILL REMIT TO PROMOEXCHANGE OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE PROMOEXCHANGE AUTHORIZED AGENT, ALL PROMOEXCHANGE FEES BY THE PAYMENT DUE DATE AND THAT FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN SELECTED SELLER BEING SUBJECT TO INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OTHER PENALTIES, UP TO AND INCLUDING COLLECTIONS ACTIVITY AND WEB SITE ACCESS REVOCATION. Unless specifically authorized by PromoExchange, Sellers are prohibited from submitting to the Buyer pricing Information related to a Buy except in accordance with the Bid Process, as set forth above. Such submission may constitute a Transaction By Other Means, as set forth in Section XV, and result in revocation or suspension of some or all of Seller’s Web Site access privileges and/or ability to use the Services. Buyers and Sellers are responsible for paying all expenses associated with conducting their respective businesses, whether selling, bidding, or buying through PromoExchange or accessing the Web Site. PromoExchange retains the right to institute subscription and/or per-event management fees based on written request or authorization from applicable parties.</p>

<h4>X. Order Process</h4>
<p>The Order Process is defined as follows: 1) Upon Buyer’s selection of a Bid, the Selected Seller will be notified by email of its selection and will then have one (1) business day to review its selection for accuracy and to confirm inventory. PROMOEXCHANGE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INSUFFICIENCY OF QUANTITY OF INVENTORY AT ANY POINT IN THE SELLLING PROCESS. SELLER WILL IMMEDIATELY OR AS SOON AS PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE NOTIFY BUYER OF ANY AND ALL INVENTORY SHORTAGES. BUYER WILL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES TO CANCEL OR AMEND THE ORDER. If the Selected Seller declines, the Auction continues and Buyer may select a new Bid. 2) Upon acceptance, the parties may exchange any Attachments through the Web Site. 3) The Selected Seller shall then provide a virtual proof of the Promotional Merchandise within two (2) business days or, if no production proof is required, production begins. All proofs shall be provided through the Web Site and approvals shall also be posted on the Web Site. 4) Upon shipment of the Order, the Selected Seller shall enter the shipping information on the Web Site. 5) Within three (3) business days after receipt of the Promotional Merchandise, Buyer shall either (1) confirm accuracy of the delivered Promotional Merchandise, at which point payment is due (if a Preferred Seller) or payment will be released by PromoExchange (if a Clearinghouse transaction); or (2) dispute the accuracy of the delivered Promotional Merchandise by notifying PromoExchange and the Selected Seller.</p>

<p>If the Selected Seller invoices the Buyer, the Selected Seller must adhere to Buyer requirements by ensuring the following: 1) All Orders have been delivered in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Order and RFB, and 2) All invoice pricing EXACTLY matches the pricing, including PromoExchange Fees, set forth in the Order. Failure to adhere to either of these requirements is disruptive to the Order Process, is a violation of these Terms of Use, and may result in delayed payment, non-payment, or a negative rating through use of the Rating System by the Buyer and imposition of late payment fees or other penalties, including suspension or revocation of some or all of the Selected Seller’s Web Site access privileges, by PromoExchange.</p>

<h4>XI. Shipping and Delivery</h4>
<p>All Orders placed through PromoExchange shall be shipped and delivered in accordance with the Specifications set forth by the Buyer in the RFB. The default shipping condition is set as free-on-board destination (FOB Destination) standard ground transportation. Buyer shall have the option, in the RFB, of setting the shipping method and delivery date. A Selected Seller’s failure to ship and deliver in compliance with the Specifications may subject such party to negative ratings from Buyers and may lead to suspension or revocation of some or all of such Seller’s PromoExchange access privileges. Selected Seller’s failure to ship and deliver in compliance with the Specifications resulting in the Buyer’s partial payment or non-payment to the Selected Seller shall not relieve the Selected Seller of its obligation to submit all PromoExchange Fees included in the Bid by the Payment Due Date.</p>

<h4>XII. General Payment Terms for Standard Payment Process and Clearinghouse Process</h4>
<p>Preferred Seller = Direct, non-Preferred = Clearinghouse</p>
<p>Clearinghouse allows either CC or electronic check</p>

<p>Clearinghouse Method: In the event the Selected Seller is not a Preferred Seller, Buyer must remit payment of the Bid Price of the Selected Bid through PromoExchange or directly to the PromoExchange Authorized Agent, PromoExchange will only accept the entire Bid Price paid by Buyers. Partial payment will not be accepted. Payment is due at the time the Buyer identifies the Selected Bid. Payment may be made by credit card or by electronic check through the Web Site. PromoExchange or the PromoExchange Authorized Agent will then remit the Bid Price paid by Buyer less the PromoExchange Fee to the Seller not more than 30 days after delivery of the Order. In the intervening period, PromoExchange will keep all funds in an interest-bearing escrow account. Multiple payments may be maintained in the account simultaneously, including payments from different Buyers. PromoExchange shall have the sole right, title, and interest in any interest payments, and both Buyer and Seller hereby disclaim any interest they may have had, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to such interest payments.</p>

<p>Direct Method: Where the Selected Seller is a Preferred Seller, Buyer may choose to remit payment of the Bid Price directly to Seller. In such instance, Buyer will remit payment in accordance with Seller’s provisions of payment. Seller will then remit payment of the PromoExchange Fee to PromoExchange or the PromoExchange Authorized Agent prior to the Payment Due Date. Notwithstanding the status of any payment by Buyer, no later than the Payment Due Date, the Selected Seller shall remit all PromoExchange Fees to PromoExchange or to the PromoExchange Authorized Agent.,Failure to do so may result in PromoExchange taking any or all of the following actions: 1) accruing interest on all outstanding PromoExchange Fee amounts in accordance with this Section XII; 2) revoking the Selected Seller’s Web Site access, refer the Selected Seller’s account to PromoExchange’s collection agency, submit to the Better Business Bureau and/or any applicable trade or industry associations a formal complaint regarding the Selected Seller’s delinquent payment; or iii) take any other lawful action to obtain payment of outstanding PromoExchange Fees.</p>

<p>Provisions Applicable to Both Methods of Payment: Any payment of the PromoExchange Fee remitted to PromoExchange or the PromoExchange Authorized Agent after the Payment Due Date is subject to interest penalties in the amount of one and one-half percent (1.5%) annual interest compounded monthly.</p>

<h4>XIII. Attachments</h4>
<p>Buyers may include Attachments to a RFB during the “Create Buy” process, subject to PromoExchange system Attachment size limitations. Buyers are required to scan all Attachments with anti-virus software prior to posting on PromoExchange. PromoExchange does NOT review or filter Buyer Attachments, and is NOT responsible for the content or condition of those Attachments. Sellers may not include Attachments until after Seller becomes a Selected Seller. Buyer or Seller, as applicable, agrees to indemnify PromoExchange for any and all suits, losses, claims, demands, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney and accounting fees) incurred due to any delivery by such party of any Virus to PromoExchange. Please note that, unless specifically authorized by PromoExchange, Sellers are prohibited from including pricing Information within Attachments, as such inclusion may constitute a Transaction By Other Means, as set forth in Section XV. Should the Seller provide such information to the Buyer, resulting in exclusion of the PromoExchange Fee from Buyer’s Order, Seller will remain liable for full payment of the PromoExchange Fee pursuant to these Terms of Use. In addition, PromoExchange, at its sole discretion, may revoke or suspend some or all of Seller’s PromoExchange access privileges.</p>

<h4>XIV. Incomplete Transactions and Refunds</h4>
<p>PromoExchange will refund PromoExchange Fees to Sellers only for Orders cancelled by the Buyer for reasons unrelated to Seller’s violation of the terms of the RFB, the Order, or these Terms of Use.</p>

<h4>XV. Transactions by Other Means</h4>
<p>PromoExchange is an Independent Venue for serious Buyers and Sellers to complete electronic procurements through Reverse Auctions. Buyers and Sellers attempting to misappropriate Information for purposes of circumventing the Bid Process in order to defraud PromoExchange, avoid payment of any PromoExchange Fee, or otherwise contravene, hinder, avoid, or interfere with the competitive process may have some or all of their PromoExchange access privileges suspended or revoked, at the sole discretion of PromoExchange. By agreeing to these Terms of Use, Buyers and Sellers acknowledge the importance of utilizing PromoExchange exclusively to complete each Buy initiated on the Web Site and agree to utilize PromoExchange exclusively for each such Buy until such time that the Selected Seller is chosen or the RFB is withdrawn or cancelled.
