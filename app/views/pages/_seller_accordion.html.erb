          If the Buyer pays through PromoExchange, the PromoExchange fee will be automatically deducted from the purchase price before your net price is sent to you. Otherwise, the fee is due within 10 days of auction completion. You will receive an invoice via e-mail to pay by web check/ACH. You can choose to pay by credit card as well, but the processing fee (2.9% plus an additional $0.05) will be passed along to you.
